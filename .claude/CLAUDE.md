# Personal Preferences

## Git guidelines

- NEVER commit, push, create branches, or create PRs without explicit user approval.
- Before any git operation that creates or modifies a commit, present a review block containing: changeset entry (if applicable), commit title, and commit/PR description. ALWAYS wait for approval.
- Write commit and PR descriptions as natural flowing prose. Do NOT insert hard line breaks mid-paragraph.
- Unless conflicting with a project guideline, start PR descriptions with "This PR...".
